    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would advice them to use encryption, to have updated software and use validation. I would also recommend have the software on auto-update and run security checks on a regular basis</p>
